My First Solo Project: Tesla Clone

This project is my first solo endeavor, where I recreated a simplified version of the Tesla website using only HTML and CSS. It served as an opportunity for me to apply and practice the skills I've learned while embarking on my journey into web development.

 Features

- Basic layout: The clone replicates the main layout and design elements of the Tesla website, including the homepage and vehicle detail pages.
- Static content: All content on the clone is static and does not involve any backend or dynamic functionality.
- Learning experience: This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience with HTML and CSS, as well as practice structuring web pages and styling elements.

 Usage

To view the Tesla clone, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can navigate through the different pages of the clone to explore its layout and design.

 Reflections

In creating this project, I encountered various challenges and learning opportunities. Reflecting on my experience, I gained a deeper understanding of HTML and CSS fundamentals, and I'm excited to continue learning and improving my skills in future projects.

 Credits

This project was conceptualized and developed by Naledi Leshakhe as a personal learning project.
